                            <p class="mb-0">This is the most important rule. The standard "Automatic Updates" feature in
                                macOS doesn't know about the special OCLP configuration. To prevent issues, we always
                                use a simple, safe manual update process. Ensure all toggles are OFF in <strong>System
                                    Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic updates</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Before any update, create a full backup of your system using Time Machine and an external
                                hard drive. This is your ultimate "undo button" and safety net, allowing you to restore
                                your Mac to its exact previous state if anything goes wrong.</p>

                        <p class="text-center mb-4">The OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP) is an intelligent application
                            that often guides you through the update process. The key is to follow its prompts. Here is
                            the typical workflow:</p>

                        <div class="guide-card">
                            <div class="step-number">Step 1</div>
                            <h3>Check for OCLP Prompts & Prepare</h3>
                            <p>Before you do anything, open the <strong>OpenCore-Patcher</strong> app from your
                                Applications folder. OCLP will automatically check for updates and prompt you if its own
                                application or bootloader is out of date. <strong>Always accept these updates
                                    first.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Sometimes, when you check for a macOS update in System
                                Settings, OCLP will detect this and proactively prompt you to download necessary
                                libraries in advance. If you see this prompt, accept it. This makes the final patching
                                step much faster.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="guide-card">
                            <div class="step-number">Step 2</div>
                            <h3>Install the macOS Update</h3>
                            <p>Once OCLP is up-to-date (or if it didn't prompt you for an update), you can proceed. Go
                                to <strong>System Settings > General > Software Update</strong> and click "Update Now."
                                Your iMac will download and install the update, which may take some time and involve
                                several restarts. This is normal.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="guide-card">
                            <div class="step-number">Step 3</div>
                            <h3>Apply Post-Install Root Patches</h3>
                            <p>This is the final and most important step. After the macOS update is complete, the OCLP
                                app should <strong>automatically open and prompt you</strong> that "post-install root
                                patches are required." Simply follow the on-screen instructions to apply them. This
                                re-enables graphics acceleration, Wi-Fi, and other features. If it doesn't open
                                automatically, just launch it yourself and click <strong>"Post-Install Root
                                    Patch."</strong> Reboot when prompted.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, absolutely! However, it's crucial <strong>not to upgrade on release
                                            day.</strong> The OCLP community needs time (usually 2-3 months) to ensure
                                        the new OS runs perfectly on older hardware. I personally test these major
                                        upgrades and will give my clients the go-ahead once I've confirmed it's stable
